## Touchpad

### General
- Move your fingers generally on your phone to use the mouse directly like in a touchpad.
- Double tap and move your finger to drag with left click of mouse. __[This feature works properly but you will find it difficult to do it, you may drag sometimes unknowningly but when you try to drag purposefully you may find it difficult to do so, I am not sure why, I will try to perfect it]__

### Two finger gesture

- Use your two fingers to scroll like how you do usually in touchpad.

### Three finger gesture

- Use your three fingers to switch between tabs like usual.

#### Note

- The mouse sensitivity may be more than your touchpad, the Three finger gesture senstivity is also more than your touchpad, will make mechanism to reduce it or increase it later.

### Special Features
